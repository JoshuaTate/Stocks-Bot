# Stocks-Bot
A Python program that provides analysis of stocks to attempt to exploit their daily volatility to make large, short term returns.

As it is practically impossible to guess whether, or when, stocks will change in value due to the efficient market hypothesis, and due to the heterscedastic nature of
the stock market, it is reckless to try, this project has remained a demonstration rather than a useful financial program.

It is currently capable of either running in real time, or by randomly picking past stock data to test its logic against.

I intend to implement this as a sort of "Stock simulator" game so wannabe day-traders can test their mettle against real-life scenarios.
